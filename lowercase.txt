introduction
-------------

open watcom is the open source version of the commercial watcom system that was well known in
the 1990s. like its predecessor, open watcom provides compilers for fortran77, c, and c++. it
also provides a rich collection of related tools such as an assembler, a debugger, a linker, an
editor, and a simple ide to name just a few. in addition, open watcom provides good cross
platform support for windows, os/2, dos, and their variations. indeed, open watcom is one of the
few actively maintained c/c++ compilers that can still generate 16 bit x86 code for dos or
embedded targets.

the open watcom community has been working on adding linux to the list of supported systems.
right now you can create linux executables using open watcom on a windows, os/2, or even a dos
system. it is also possible to create windows, os/2, or dos executables on a linux system.
however, open watcom's linux port still requires a lot of work before it will be fully mature.
in this article i hope to describe the current state of open watcom on linux and how you can get
your hands on the source code of the system to start playing with it.

it is our hope that ultimately open watcom will become a viable alternative to gcc on linux.
because of open watcom's tradition of being as self contained as possible, it provides its own
libraries and an independent, self-consistent tool set with all the advantages (and
disadvantages) pertaining.


history
-------

open watcom's history is long. it dates back to a fortran compiler created by a group of
undergraduate students at the university of waterloo in the 1960s. in the late 1980s a c
compiler was also created. the first commercial pc version of watcom, version 6.0, was released
in 1988. the watcom product was popular in the mid-1990s, especially with game developers,
because of the fast code that it generated compared to other compilers of that time. a
corresponding c++ compiler was released with version 9.5 in 1993, and the three languages have
been a part of the system ever since.

the last commercial version of watcom, version 11.0, was released in 1997/1998. sybase, the
owner of the system at the time, announced in 1999 that watcom would be moved to "end of life"
status and no longer available as a commercial product. however, in 2000 sybase released the
watcom system as an open source product and thus open watcom was born. scitech software used the
perforce source code management system to maintain and host the open watcom code base until
2007; perforce software has provided hosting for the project since then.

releasing the watcom source openly was feasible because it had relatively few dependencies on
third party components. most of the tools and libraries used during the build of open watcom are
part of open watcom. this made the open source version relatively self contained. yet a
considerable amount of work was still necessary before open watcom could compile its own source
code. certain parts of open watcom, such as the port to qnx, are still not functional because of
missing proprietary libraries. it wasn't until version 1.1 before the system could reasonably
build itself.

at the time of this writing, the current version of open watcom is 1.7a. in the years since it
has been opened, progress has been made on updating the c compiler to the c99 standard and the
c++ compiler to the c++98 standard. each release brings open watcom incrementally closer to
these goals as well as fixes numerous bugs in the previous release. in addition, the tools and
libraries have been enhanced. for example, open watcom supports the "safer c" extensions to the
standard c library (iso/iec tr 24731, "extensions to the c library, part i: bounds-checking
interfaces")[can this be a footnote?] and provides a partially complete, fresh implementation of
the c++ standard template library.


what works, what doesn't
-------------------------

currently open watcom is immature on linux. the system can be both compiled using the linux
version of open watcom, for example as generated on a windows machine, and bootstrapped from
gcc. however, the build process, and especially the bootstrap process, is a bit delicate. work
is underway to make the open watcom source more portable specifically to allow reliable
bootstrapping not only on linux, but other *nixes as well.

open watcom uses its own c and c++ run time libraries and thus does not need to interact with
glibc. while this is nice in some respects, it clearly would be useful for it to have the
ability to use standard linux shared libraries. the object file format used by the compilers
(omf) is unusual on linux systems. the open watcom linker is able to read this format and write
elf executables, but can not at this time create or use elf shared objects. this means that open
watcom programs are somewhat isolated and are not able to tap into important shared libraries
such as those for the x window system. currently on linux the entire source code for a program
must be compiled with open watcom.

on windows and os/2 open watcom provides a collection of gui based tools. this is accomplished
by using an open watcom specific cross platform gui library that has been ported to the
supported graphical systems. however, at the time of this writing, none of the gui tools work on
linux. to fix this, one approach would be to port the current cross platform gui library to a
linux graphical tool kit such as gtk. however, it has been suggested that such a port would be
difficult due to the current windows and os/2 assumptions made in the gui library. the open
watcom wiki discusses these matters in more detail.

despite the limitations there is much that does work. essentially all of the command line tools
work. in addition a text mode ("tui" style interface) version of the debugger and editor works.
the language required standard libraries are provided, to the extent they are provided on any
platform, and enough linux specific functionality is available to write some useful programs.


cross compiling to linux
------------------------

before discussing cross compilation, i should introduce a bit of terminology. the system on
which you run the open watcom tools is the "host system." the system for which you are
generating programs is the "target system." finally if you build the compiler from source, the
system on which you do this is the "build system."

i will talk a little about how to build open watcom on linux shortly. however, you don't
actually need to build the compiler if you just want to experiment with open watcom's support
for linux. instead you can cross compile to the linux target from any of the supported host
systems. proceed as follows:

1. from the open watcom web site download the latest installer for either windows or os/2.

2. during installation you will be prompted for which hosts you want to install. ordinarily you
only need a single host, and usually that's the same as the system on which you are installing.
you can install multiple hosts if you intend to dual-boot your machine, or if you intend to make
the installation visible to other operating systems in some other way, such as over a network or
in a virtual machine.

3. later in the installation you will be prompted for which targets you want to install. each
host can generate all possible targets so the host and target questions are independent. for
our purposes you will want to select at least the experimental linux target.

when the installation finishes you are ready to cross compile to linux from your windows or os/2
system. to make a rudimentary test, enter the classic program shown in listing 1. compile it
with the 32 bit generating c compiler as follows

wcc386 -i=c:\watcom\lh -bt=linux hello.c

the -bt option specifies the "build type." by default wcc386 assumes you are targeting the same
system as your host. you need to override this default for cross compilations. you also need to
explicitly specify the path to the linux library headers. the result of the above command is an
omf object file named hello.obj. next link this object file against the linux version of the run
time library as follows

wlink sys linux file hello.obj

the open watcom linker's command line is a collection of keywords followed by arguments for
those keywords. the command above specifies that you are trying to build a linux executable from
the given object file. the result of this command is a file named hello.elf. to run it, just
copy this file to your favorite linux system and give yourself execute permission to it.

you can also use the open watcom ide (a thin graphical wrapper around the command line tools) to
cross compile to linux by simply selecting the "linux" target type when defining your project.
the ide takes care of all the necessary compiler and linker options.

notice that because open watcom provides its own run time library and tools, it is not necessary
to install any gnu-like tools or libraries on the host system. furthermore since open watcom
currently only uses static linking when building linux executables, the final program is
entirely self-contained and independent of the libraries that are present on the linux machine
where it runs.


building open watcom for linux
------------------------------

if your nearest windows machine is in the dumpster out back, you might want to build the
experimental linux host natively on your linux box. the most well tested way to generate the
linux host is actually to cross compile it from a windows or os/2 machine. however, here i will
describe how to bootstrap open watcom on a linux system using gcc.

the first step is, of course, getting the source code itself. the open watcom project uses the
perforce source code management system. since you might not be familiar with perforce, i will
give detailed instructions on how to use perforce to access the open watcom source repository.
although perforce is a commercial product, qualified open source projects can use the server for
free. in addition client programs can be downloaded for free from the perforce web site. both
windows and linux clients are supported. although perforce provides a graphical client for their
system, using the command line client (p4) is often more convenient and that is the approach i
describe here.

once you have downloaded and installed a perforce client for your system you will need to
configure some environment variables as shown in listing 2. these settings direct the client to
the open watcom repository (or "depot" in perforce terms). each working copy of the source code
(or "client workspace" in perforce terms) is identified by the p4client environment variable.
the name of your workspace is up to you, but it must be unique on the server. use a name in the
form shown in the listing; for example, peterc_devbox_linux. if everyone uses this form
uniqueness is virtually guaranteed since it is highly unlikely that another person using your
name would also choose the same names and operating systems for his or her machines. execute the
command 'p4 info' to check your connection to the server. you should see some information about
the server and not, for example, error messages.

next you need to define the mapping from files in the depot to locations on your machine. this
is called the "client mapping" and it is part of the definition of your client workspace.
execute the command 'p4 client' to load the current definition (a default) into your editor of
choice. it is essential to change two fields. the first names the location of the source tree
root. the other specifies how a particular view of the source is mapped into your client
workspace.

root: /home/pchapin/ow
view: //depot/openwatcom/... //peterc_devbox_linux/...

when you exit your editor p4 will update the definition of your client workspace on the server.
finally download the head revision with the command 'p4 sync'.

once you have the source you need to adjust one file before attempting a bootstrap build. in the
root of the source tree, copy the file setvars.sh to setvars and edit the file to reflect your
configuration. note especially the setting of the owroot environment variable. this variable
should contain the absolute path of the root of the source tree. next execute the build.sh shell
script to bootstrap the linux compilers using gcc.

the linux bootstrap build of open watcom is not as well tested or as refined as the build
procedure on windows or os/2. however, if it completes successfully you will have a rel2
directory beneath the source tree root containing the native linux version of open watcom. only
a subset of the entire system is built this way; specifically only the linux host and target are
generated.

if you want to build the entire system using the freshly created tools, you should source
setvars into a shell, which adds the linux host just created to the path (among other things).
then change into the bld directory beneath the source tree and execute the command 'builder
rel2'. note that even this does not build the documentation. this is because some of the
documentation generation tools are dos programs, and executing dos programs on linux requires
extra steps that have not been automated. there is work on correcting this by creating linux
versions of the necessary tools, but that work is not yet completed.

once the system has been built you might want to run some regression tests. the tests are driven
by wmake, open watcom's make utility, and must be run separately for each subproject. for
example, to run the c compiler regression tests, change to the bld/ctest/regress directory and
execute wmake. the c++ compiler regression tests are in bld/plustest/regress.


using open watcom on linux
--------------------------

once the build is complete, you can copy the rel2 directory anywhere on your system and set up
the environment variables as shown in listing 3. since you are now using native compilers you
can use the open watcom compile and link utility to build simple programs easily. for example
issuing the following command on your linux system builds the simple hello program i discussed
before.

wcl386 hello.c

note that the text mode version of the open watcom debugger is available on linux. compile your
program with the -d2 option and then run wd to launch it. in addition wmake can be used to
coordinate the construction of larger programs, and open watcom's editor (a vi clone) can be
used for preparing source files.

you might also find the owcc utility interesting. this program is a front end that is intended
to provide a gnu-like interface to the open watcom compilers. the idea is to make the open
watcom compilers sufficiently compatible with gcc so that one can easily switch to open watcom
in gcc enabled makefiles. open watcom provides a microsoft nmake emulation for similar reasons.


the future
----------

we believe the future of open watcom on linux is bright. although not yet usable for serious
programming in the linux environment, open watcom already has many of the necessary pieces ready
to support such programming. with a bit more tender loving care, open watcom could become a
viable alternative to gcc. when this happens, linux developers will have more choices. that is,
after all, what open source software is all about.

for more information about the current state of open watcom on linux we invite you to review the
wiki and participate in the newsgroups. we look forward to talking with you!
